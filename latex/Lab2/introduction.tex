The research question given by the company was \textit{What are the pros and 
    cons of different SLAM algorithms which are suitable for autonomous vehicles?}.
In the thesis description, there is a stated desire for a comprehensible 
comparison between different SLAM algorithms, both on the performance of the 
algorithm and the price of the needed hardware. The final deliverable will be a
comprehensive comparison of perfomance (in simulation and in real life) and the
cost associated with needed sensors.
