\section*{Research question refinement}
\label{sec:rqref}

In hinesight of the, in Section~\ref{sec:rqref}, defined refinement method
there is a huge gain in iterating the search wisely. It is likely that the
results from one of the searches will contain keywords used when describing
other methods. It can also be possible to discard some search results based
soely on them containg specific keywords. Using multiple sources will help in
getting an as complete picture of the method as possible.
