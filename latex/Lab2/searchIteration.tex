The initial search string used is,
\begin{align}
    &\text{(slam OR mapping OR localization OR sensing OR modeling)} \nonumber \\ 
    &\text{AND (car OR vehicle OR agent OR uav OR robot)} \\
    &\text{AND (hardware OR sensor OR processor OR input OR data)} \nonumber
\end{align}
focusing on catching as many hardware related sources as possible.
