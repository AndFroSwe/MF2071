For learning about SLAM in general, the following search string was used in Scopus:
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview1}
    &\text{((slam) OR (simultaneous near localization near mapping))}\nonumber \\
    &\text{AND SUBJAREA (comp, engi)}
\end{align}
This limited search results to SLAM sources within computer science and
engineering. It yielded 7617 results. Since a general overview was wanted, 
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview2}
    &\text{AND (overview OR tutorial OR primer OR basics)}
\end{align}
was added to search string (\ref{search:overview1}). The result was 1471 results.
Often, books might be better at giving an overview of a subject than scientific
papers, so
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview3}
    &\text{AND DOCTYPE (bk)}
\end{align}
was added. This yielded 8 results and one source,~\cite{Kernbach20131}. It also
yielded a synonym to ``overview'' \textit{fundamentals}. 
Finding nothing more on Scopus, a tentative search is also made in KTH Primo.
Starting  simply with searching for
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview4}
    &\text{slam AND overview}.
\end{align}
This gave 198 results, many irrelevant but 2 relevant sources were
found,~\cite{Frese2010} and~\cite{5769022}.

Another approach can be to try and find the earlier publications that is
describing the problem or the solution to SLAM\@. The search term,
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview5}
    &\text{slam AND (problem OR solution)} 
\end{align}
gives 335 results and even though the search term was short, it yielded some
relevant results, both~\cite{938381} and~\cite{844732}. It can also be
interesting to look at the implementation part of the problem, so the search
term
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview6}
    &\text{slam AND (problem OR solution) AND implementation} 
\end{align}
gave 42 results where a good review from 2015 was found~\cite{7482163}.
