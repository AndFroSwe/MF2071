For learning about SLAM in general, the following seach string was used in Scopus:
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview1}
    &\text{ ((slam) OR (simultaneous near localization near mapping))}\nonumber \\
    &\text{AND SUBJAREA (comp, engi)}
\end{align}
This limited search results to SLAM sources within computer sciense and
engineering. It yielded 7617 results. Since a general overview was wanted, 
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview2}
    &\text{AND (overview OR tutorial OR primer OR basics)}
\end{align}
was added to seach string (\ref{search:overview1}). The result was 1471 results.
Often, books might be better at giving an overview of a subject than scientific
papers, so
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview3}
    &\text{AND DOCTYPE (bk)}
\end{align}
was added. This yielded 8 results and one source,~\cite{Kernbach20131}. It also
yielded a synonym to ``overview'' \textit{fundamentals}. 
Finding nothing more on Scopus, a tentative search is also made in KTH Primo.
Starting  simply with searching for
\begin{align}
    \label{search:overview4}
    &\text{slam AND overview}.
\end{align}
This gave 198 results, many irrelevant but 2 relevant sources were found,
~\cite{Frese2010} and~\cite{5769022}.

The initial search string used is,
\begin{align}
    &\text{(slam OR mapping OR localization OR sensing OR modeling)} \nonumber \\ 
    &\text{AND (car OR vehicle OR agent OR uav OR robot)} \\
    &\text{AND (hardware OR sensor OR processor OR input OR data)} \nonumber
\end{align}
focusing on catching as many hardware related sources as possible.
