Being rather wide in scope, the research question is divided into smaller parts
that each can have a specific search strategy. As previously stated, the focus
is on making a comparison of different SLAM algorithms with regards to
performance in different situations and the cost associated with each algorithm.
The cost will depend on both the needed processing power and on what kind of
inputs are needed, affecting which sensors that need to be fitted to the
vehicle.The goals of the search are therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To define what a SLAM algorithm is.
    \item To (if possible) find all available SLAM algorithms.
    \item To investigate theoretical performance of each.
    \item To investigate what inputs and processing power are needed for each.
\end{enumerate}
