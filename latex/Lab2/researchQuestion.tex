The research question given by AVL is \textit{What are the pros and
cons of different SLAM algorithms which are suitable for autonomous vehicles?}.
In the thesis description, there is a stated desire for a comprehensible
comparison between different SLAM
algorithms, both on the performance of the algorithm and the price of the
needed hardware. The final deliverable will be a comprehensive comparison of
perfomance (in simulation and in real life) and the cost associated with needed
sensors. Being rather wide in scope, the research question can be divided into
more specific questions that will help in answering the more abstract research
question. The algorithms computing cost will depend on both the needed
processing power and
on what kind of inputs are needed, affecting which sensors that need to be
fitted to the vehicle. The more specific questions that will need to be answered is therefor, 
\begin{itemize}
    \item What is the definition of a SLAM algorithm?
    \item Which SLAM algorithms are available and relevant?
    \item What is the theoretical performance of each algorithm?
    \item What input and processing power are needed for each algorithm?
    \end{itemize}
