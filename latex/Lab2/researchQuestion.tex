The research question given by the company was \textit{What are the pros and
cons of different SLAM algorithms which are suitable for autonomous vehicles?}.
In the thesis description, there is a stated desire for a comprehensible
comparison between different Simultanious Location And Mapping (SLAM)
algorithms, both on the performance of the algorithm and the price of the
needed hardware. The final deliverable will be a comprehensive comparison of
perfomance (in simulation and in real life) and the cost associated with needed
sensors.  Being rather wide in scope, the research question is divided into
smaller parts that each can have a specific search strategy. As previously
stated, the focus is on making a comparison of different SLAM algorithms with
regards to performance in different situations and the cost associated with
each algorithm.  The cost will depend on both the needed processing power and
on what kind of inputs are needed, affecting which sensors that need to be
fitted to the vehicle.The goals of the search are therefore:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item To define what a SLAM algorithm is.
    \item To (if possible) find all available SLAM algorithms.
    \item To investigate theoretical performance of each.
    \item To investigate what inputs and processing power are needed for each.
\end{enumerate}
