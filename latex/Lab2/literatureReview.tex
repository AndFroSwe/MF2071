It can be rather difficult to find good primary sources when searching for
scientific material of the overview kind. Usually, scientific journals and
articles focus on deepening existing knowledge and are therefore very specific
by nature. Still, some good material was found.

In~\cite{Frese2010}, the authors present SLAM from a users perspective, covering
the practical aspects of the algorithms. This is suitable since it does not
focus too much on specific algorithms but focuses on giving a practical
overview. The authors work within the field, making the it a valuable primary
source. Likewise,~\cite{5769022} focuses on a capturing SLAM as a wide overview.
Finally in ~\cite{Kernbach20131}, the author writes about collective robotics
which is a bit too specific but it also gives an wide look at SLAM algorithms.
In this search, sources from course material has been avoided. These give a good
personal understanding but it can be difficult to confirm the validity of the
data in the source. One of these is an open coursware course from MIT OCW.
