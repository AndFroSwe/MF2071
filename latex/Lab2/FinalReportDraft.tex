\section*{Introduction}
The research question given by the company was \textit{What are the pros and 
    cons of different SLAM algorithms which are suitable for autonomous vehicles?}.
In the thesis description, there is a stated desire for a comprehensible 
comparison between different SLAM algorithms, both on the performance of the 
algorithm and the price of the needed hardware. 

\section{Search Method}
Since there is a variety of suitable SLAM methods that could be used in
autonomous cars there is a need to define the scope of this quantity. The first
real important task would be to try to find the relevant methods and categorize
them. Once these have been categorized they would need to be researched further
one by one to get a sufficient amount of information about them each of them.
Using multiple sources will help in getting an as complete picture of the
method as possible.
