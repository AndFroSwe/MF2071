\section{Search Method}
Since there is a variety of suitable SLAM methods that could be used in
autonomous cars there is a need to define the scope of this quantity. The first
real important task would be to try to find the relevant methods and categorize
them. Once these have been categorized they would need to be researched further
one by one to get a sufficient amount of information about them each of them.
Using multiple sources will help in getting an as complete picture of the
method as possible.

\section{Search Strings}
The initial search string used is,
\begin{align}
    &\text{(slam OR mapping OR localization OR sensing OR modeling)} \nonumber \\ 
    &\text{AND (car OR vehicle OR agent OR uav OR robot)} \\
    &\text{AND (hardware OR sensor OR processor OR input OR data)} \nonumber
\end{align}
