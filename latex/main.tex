% Q1A: Describe your field of studies and its scientific context. Break out an information need that you find
%relevant. It is good if this information need is for your thesis or a similar report. Try to be as specific as
%possible.
My field of studies is Mechatronics, built upon a bachelors degree in Mechanical
engineering. Mechatronics is often described as the unity of control systems,
computers, mechanical systems and electronic systems. Because of the wide spread
of subjects a mechatronics engineer has knowledge of, the engineer might be 
considered a jack of all trades, master of none. The strength of this focus on 
being not focused is that the mechatronic engineer is a specialist on integrating
all the subjects into one final design. 

This home exam, and the work in this course, will be based on the master thesis
job I will do at AVL Powertrain Engineering. AVL is the worlds largest independent
company focusing on development and testing of powertrains and drivelines and is
based in Graz, Austria. This thesis will be done for the AVL branch in 
S\"{o}dert\"{a}lje, Sweden. They want an autonomous car that can be used for
testing and research and as a part of that project, they want to investigate
which localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithm that is suitable to use 
from a cost/performance perspective. More specifically, different SLAM algorithms
have different performance and different demands on sensors and hardware 
calculation capacity. Also, some algotihms perform well in simulation but not in the 
field. 

There is both a technical aspect of the information need, the investigation of
different SLAM algorithms and their pros and cons, and a subjective aspect in 
the choice of what makes a ``good'' algorithm for this specific purpose. For this 
report, the technical aspect is chosen to be expanded upon since the largest part 
of the thesis will be the gathering and investigation of different algorithms.
% Q1B: Use the problem from question 1A. Can you find different angles to approach this problem/
%information need? Describe why this is an advanced information need. Also describe which sources
%you need to solve the information need. (Hint: If you canâ€™t find any reasons to why you would need
%information from several sources the information need is not advanced enough for this course).
